                Hi, My name is Mack Jones, and I have a passion for coding/software development. I've always loved making things ever since I was little, so my passion eventually lead me into software/game development. In the past, I have worked in things such as Game Development and Computer Science either for education or for personal projects, so I have acquired somewhat of a basic Developer skillset. My hobbies include coding for fun, playing video games, reading books/comics/manga, watching TV shows/anime, and trying to catch up on sleep whenever I can (I'm perpetually tired). I'm always down for a challenge, and I enjoy tackling new concepts whenever I can.
            </p>

            <p>
                My previous experience includes education at Johnson County Community College for Game Development/Computer Science (2 years), Computer Science at Wichita State University/Fort Hays State University (an additional 1 1/2 years), and dabbling in some side-projects along the way. After Centriq, I plan to continue to expand my experience/skillset by continuing to work on future projects.
